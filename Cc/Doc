Summary:
The goal is to design a reliable, scalable, and maintainable system using Azure services. It should enable efficient communication, environment-specific integration, and robust delivery tracking across components.

Key Points:

Use Azure for reliable and scalable architecture

Ensure efficient cross-service communication

Enable environment-based configuration and integration

Implement delivery tracking with message IDs or URLs

Design for easy maintenance and future scalability
